# NutriTrack 🥗📊

NutriTrack is a cross-platform nutrition tracking application that helps users track daily food intake, analyze nutritional values, and predict calorie consumption using Machine Learning.

This project was developed collaboratively with my friends.  
**My primary contribution was Backend Development using Spring Boot**, including REST APIs, authentication, and ML service integration.

## 🚀 Project Overview

NutriTrack is built as a modular system consisting of three components:

### 1️⃣ Flutter App (Frontend)
- Cross-platform mobile application (Android & iOS)
- Clean and interactive UI
- Food logging and meal history
- Displays nutritional insights
- Communicates with backend via REST APIs

### 2️⃣ Spring Boot Backend (API) — My Role
- RESTful API architecture
- User authentication & authorization using JWT
- Stores user and food data
- Business logic implementation
- Integrates with ML service
- Secure and scalable backend

### 3️⃣ Machine Learning Service
- Food classification
- Calorie estimation
- Nutrition prediction
- Exposed as REST API
- Extendable to image-based food recognition
